# Development Thoughts
As I work on this, sometimes ideas pop into my head but I'm not ready to implement them just yet. To keep on track, I made this file so I could pause for a second, jot the thought down, and then continue with what I was working on.

##### Store robot configurations
Since the software already uses a settings module, take advantage of this to save the JSON configuration for different telemetry setups. That way a simple select box can be used to switch between different projects easily.

##### JSON configuration
Send telemetry as a data object in JSON.

data = {
  heading: robot heading in degrees,
  power: The primary battery voltage or fuel level. The gauge is configurable so it just needs to be configured for the proper data for your setup.,
  temperature: The temperature of the main control electronics (BeagleBone, Raspberry Pi, Jetson) or a motor. Again the gauge is configurable.
  speed: How fast the robot is traveling.
  peripherals: {
    motor_1: {
      amperage: amps,
      voltage: volts,
      speed: rpm
    },
    motor_2: {
      amperage: amps,
      voltage: volts,
      speed: rpm
    },
    gps: {
      latitude: 96,
      longitude: 96,
      elevation: 3600,
      satellites: 6
    },
    air_temp: 30 celcius
    barometer: 20psi
  }
}
